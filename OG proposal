Project Details: We will be utilizing Unity to create a game for our final project, some of current ideas for games are a pinball 
game or a mobile runner game. We will be adding functions and utilities to our game as we learn unity and get better understanding of things we can do. 
Some ideas for some functions to put into the game are levels, pauses/saves, soundtracks/effects and other things that will make the game more enjoyable and 
fun to play at a high-level
