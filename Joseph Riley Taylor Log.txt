User Manual: 
- Open the folder called Mario Platformer
- Open the URL link called Mario 2D Platformer Style - Unity Play
- Click play and the game will work
- Arrows keys to move, space to jump
- Nothing special required to play the game, it all works off of unity and can be played from the website link

Issues:
- All of our games are seperate as we could not figure out a way to combine them in the end.
- Because we didn't understand how unity works, we thought we could all just make a game and combine the scenes together
- This did not work and caused many issues regarding player movment and getting the scenes to even appear properly
- We decided to all just upload our games individually to the Unity website to make them easily accessible.
