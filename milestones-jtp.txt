Justin Palumbo final project 2/13/23
WEEK 1: 
-created git hub repo and timelog/milestones
-come up with idea with group (group is not in lab so do not have idea right now)
-after coming up with idea for final lab, start coding planning of at least 5 hours of coding and planning this week
-I think we want this project to be mostly in C and probably won't vary unless we decide to make a game
-a possible game we might want to make is minesweeper and might have the capabilities to make it this semester possibly in the terminal
