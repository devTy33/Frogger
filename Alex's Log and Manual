Complete log (in order): 26 hours
//Stole from the milestones we did awhile ago
- Group discussion and brainstorming - 1 hr
- Looking at different unity projects and working on my scene - 2 hrs
- Unity tutorials and unity videos watched - 3 hrs

- Time spent brainstorming again to agree to make an arcade and deciding what game - .5 hours
- Looking up tutorials on geometry dash - 1 hour
- Finding movement tutorials and creating the movement codes - 3 hours
- Importing and getting the astronaut on the screen and moving with the colliders and rigid body - 1.5 hour
- Generating spikes and the death code to restart the level when you hit a collider - 2 hours
- Organizing and creating the scene with the astronaut sprites - 3 hours total
- Creating the gravity flip code to let the astronaut space walk - 2 hours
  (this has several problems)
- Cleaning up scene, making you won screen, making instructions - 1 hour

Failed attempts:
- I wanted to make it to where when you pressed space, the gravity would completely flip and you
would play the game from the ceiling but the way the character was set up, it would not jump while
it was flipped and the collider kept getting stuck in the ground so I had to scratch the idea - 3 hours
- We all wanted to upload our games to the unity website so everyone can play easier but my space walk does
not work for some reason so I tried to fix it but could never get it to work - 1 hour
- We wanted to combine the games and make a main menu screen but the way our settings and functions were set up,
this was impossible. We tried to do it but couldn't figure out what to do - 2 hours


User's Manual: 
1. No personal machines used, only unity libraries. 
2. Unity compiles the codes for the scene automatically and error tests them while the scene runs
3. The game is constantly moving to the right and the only controls that are need to play are "up" to jump
and "Space" to space walk/float. The spikes have an interaction where if the player hits them, he gets positioned 
back at the start and the end has a collision that takes you to the "You Won" screen.
4. The only bug that I know of is sometimes the gravity for the space walk becomes weaker for some reason, sometimes
this goes back to normal and then other times I have to increase the gravity. The time and instructions can have some 
visual errors where they are lower or higher than they are supposed to be but it is nothing too crazy. I should mention that 
at the beginnning, there is a collider that stops you from constantly just running into the first spikes but that is
planned to help users start if they are really struggling.
5. When looking at my Geometry Dash folder, half of the codes are in GeometryDash/Assets/GeometryDash and then the other half 
are in geometryDash/Assets/Free Pixel Space Platform.../Scene. I am not sure why they are split up like this unless this is 
just how I made them in the scene itself.
